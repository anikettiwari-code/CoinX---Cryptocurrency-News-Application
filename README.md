CoinX - Crypto News App 📱

This is a real-time cryptocurrency news aggregator built with React Native and Expo. It was created as a project to demonstrate modern mobile development skills, API integration, and clean UI design.

🚀 About The Project

In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, staying informed is a real challenge. We developed the CoinX mobile app to solve this problem by creating a single, reliable source for the latest news.
